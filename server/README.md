## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app (without docker)

### Migrations
Make sure you have a PostgreSQL server available and set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to that Postgres instance, like:

```bash
$ cd server/src/
# run migrations (using [knex-migrate](https://github.com/sheerun/knex-migrate))
$ export DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:5UPP3rSecr3tPAssword@localhost:54320/knests && knex-migrate up
```

Also, there's an API endpoint that runs the migrations once the app is started:
`GET http://localhost:8000/api/migrate`

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

### GraphQL

The graphql schema is generated by merging on all the `*.graphql` files found throughout the modules. 
It is generated automatically when the app starts, or when running:

```bash
server $ node generate-typings.js
```


## Development workflow
